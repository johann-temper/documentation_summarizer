# documentation_summarizer

## *by JoTem*

I created a Little tool, to summarize technical documentations automatically using LLM SSL.

Therefore im running two different Methods:

- Self-Supervised Pretraining
- Supervised Fine-Tuning

Currently it is a CLI-Tool, but in future i plan to integrate it as a Webtool.

Here is some `code`.

```python
